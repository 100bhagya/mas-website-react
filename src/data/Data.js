      "From the text on Day 1 of MAS101 that was somewhat on the lines of ‘I am so scared and clueless, I really need some guidance’ The whole team of My Analytics School helped me get to the point where on 30th November  I remember saying ‘Don’t worry sir, by the end of the day tomorrow I will have an offer letter’.With a very exhaustive, and well curated timeline, covering every topic with ease and never for once making us feel overburdened, or overworked, and most importantly, creating an environment of healthy competition where all of us kept each other motivated to keep going, My Analytics School helped us in every way possible. Joining MAS was one of the best decisions that I made.",

After that placement season was like piece of cake for me. Being from circuital branch everyone tends to go towards software side but I had realised that it wasn't my cup of tea.MyAnalyticsSchool took care of everything From providing me with projects and sorting my internship.They provided with all the resources related to analytics, product,ML field and also bit of software fieldThe main perk of MAS was that they moulded their structure of course according to the students need.There were regular meetups, project discussion , Case studies & Guesstimates,JAM sessions and one to one mentorship program too.Also the community which was build with other students of MAS provided an edge in my placement prepration.I got placed in Flipkart as an assistant manager in business development role.The Flipkart interview was like the first professional interview I ever gave.And thanks to MAS that I was well prepared and confident in giving the interview.Feel free to contact me anytime regarding placement or anything else u think I could be of help.",

And then I came across MAS which changed this all for good.I just wanted to share a quick note and let them know that they did a really phenomenal job and I can't thank them enough for everything. I’m glad I decided to join the MAS family. Their help has made a significant impact on my interview preparation. They made it so simple.  MAS curated the best possible roadmap, showered us with best resources, created a healthy competitive atmosphere with the best-of peers and had been the emotional pillar in the times of self doubt. And I won't shy away from saying that My Analytics School played a huge role in my success.",

Thanks, MAS for providing the best mentors anybody could ever ask for. It was your guidance and resources that allowed me to crack the placements in a stress-free manner.",

      "I was determined from the first day of placements, but there were two things that concerned me much throughout the early stages. They are proper preparation and guidance. The MAS team had my back at this point. They devised the ideal timeframe, as well as challenging sectional tests, company tests, and combined tests. They also had seminars on GD, Mock Interviews, Resume Preparation, Case Study Preparation, and Communication Skills Improvement, all of which were quite beneficial to me. With time, I gained confidence in my quantitative and presentation skills. The MAS team's greatest asset is the community they have built. The placement session is obviously one of the most stressful, but the MAS team made it a fun journey. The MAS team had always gone out of their way to assist me in every way they could, and picking them was one of my greatest decisions.",

      "There was a time last year when everyone around me was preparing for their placements, whether be in core, software, or analytics, but I was still struggling to figure out what I really wanted to do. Then there came the MAS team, which not only cleared all my confusion, but also helped me in figuring out what I really wanted and was good at, and helped me get the best out of myself.On the last day before placements, instead of being nervous, I was happy that I had given my best, and learned a lot during these times, which transformed me into a more worthy person. I would like to thank the whole MAS team for their immense efforts, and recommend MAS to everyone who would like to explore analytics and consulting at its best.",

      "At first, I wasn't sure whether I should enroll in placements or not. Because back then, as per my preassumption, to grab an offer, you needed to code. But then MAS came into the picture, and I got to know about the analytics field, and after their orientation, I decided to prepare for that. After 8-9 months of intense preparation, when placements began, I was not nervous but confident enough because I knew I did my best that was in my hand.Enrolling with MAS was the best decision I took in my preparation because it made this process easier and much more effective. The best thing I like about MAS is the availability of experts from various fields and their commitment to their prepared schedule. So, I would highly recommend MAS to anyone who wants to pursue a career in analytics.",

Surprisingly very next day, I had an opportunity to attend the MAS workshop, and it was so impressive that I made my decision to join MAS at the exact moment.Being a skeptical person, I had many silly questions, but the core team members were just a call away and always encouraged us to talk to them.The journey was about 8-9 months, which included a lot of daily quizzes, tech tasks, project works, mock group discussions, a lot of motivation, and strategies. All were superb.With a very exhaustive and well-curated timeline, covering every topic withease and never for once making us feel overburdened or overworked, and most importantly,creating an environment of healthy competition where all of us kept each other motivated to keep going,My Analytics School helped us in every way possible.

From the starting day of preparation to the day of interviews, the mentors were always there from saying you have to do this, study that to you can do it, ace your interview. Everything is well planned and scheduled from the preparation of tests, group discussions and interviews with neatly sorted out courses, materials, practice tests,case studys, projects etc. I felt good when someone is already out there making my schedule what to do on that day while also providing with the content for the entire placement season. Hence deciding to join MAS was one of the best decisions I made at the right time.",

I had some experience in the field of Data Analytics, but all I needed was a little push. That was when I joined MAS101. The entire team of MAS guided me through the placement season, who created a well-crafted timeline and provided necessary study materials. They also made sure that I followed the timeline and constantly kept a check on me. In a matter of three months, I went from being completely clueless and underconfident to being able to realize my value. MAS created an atmosphere where each and every one of us enjoyed the challenge of the placement season. Joining MAS truly opened my eyes. Thanks MAS in every possible way.",
