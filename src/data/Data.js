      "From the text on Day 1 somewhat on the lines of ‘I am so scared and clueless, I really need some guidance’ The whole team of MAS helped me get to the point where on 30th November I remember saying ‘Don’t worry sir, by the end of the day I will have an offer letter’. With a exhaustive, and well curated timeline, covering every topic with ease and never for once making us feel overburdened, and most importantly, creating an environment of healthy competition where all of us kept each other motivated to keep going, MAS helped us in every way possible. Joining MAS was one of the best decisions that I made.",

      "I was determined from the day1 of prep, but there were two things that concerned me, i.e proper preparation and guidance. MAS had my back at this point. MAS devised the ideal timeframe, as well as challenging sectional tests, company tests, and combined tests. They also had seminars on GD, Mock Interviews, Resume Preparation, Case Study Preparation, and Communication Skills Improvement, all of which were quite beneficial to me. With time, I gained confidence in my skills. MAS's greatest asset is the community they have built. The placement session is obviously very stressful, but MAS made it fun.",

      "It was in November when I decided I would like to pursue my career in analytics. I found MAS and I approached them. When the batch started, I got a detailed plan of the next months. It was incredible how MAS helped me improve my quantitative abilities simultaneously diving deeper into tools like SQL,Python and understanding ML and stats. The projects were the best in the industry and were suited for the analytics role creating a huge impact in my resume. Finally the case sessions were wonderful and super interactive and the mock interviews by MAS at the end proved to be gamechanger which helped me spot my weakness related to my candidature.",

Thanks, MAS for providing the best mentors anybody could ever ask for. It was your guidance and resources that allowed me to crack the placements in a stress-free manner.",

      "Back in August, I was so underconfident for placements that I was contemplating a dual-degree. I had some experience in the field of Analytics, but all I needed was a little push. That was when I joined MAS101. The entire team of MAS guided me through the placement season, created a well-crafted timeline and provided necessary materials. They also made sure that I followed the timeline and constantly kept a check on me. In a matter of three months, I went from being completely clueless and underconfident to being able to realize my value. MAS created an atmosphere where every one of us enjoyed the challenge of placement. Joining MAS truly opened my eyes.",

Course was well curated, structured  and comprehensive. All the study material, regular tests , regular meetups, tech and non tech grilling sessions , resume building , project discussions, coding tests was worth each second of the time devoted and penny spent. The mentors are great and were there at all the times. I can confidently say that you do not have to look for any other resources outside MAS, the resources provided are perfect to crack any company test and interview. ",
