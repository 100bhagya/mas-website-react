      "Until march 2020, I was preparing for software roles but could neither get an internship nor was I able to crack any test for SDE. I got an internship in JSW on an analytics based project and then I decided to get into analytics based companies. I was totally clueless about the resume and the right way for preparation ahead. Aryan bhaiya curated a time-based study plan to ace placement and recommended some must-do courses and projects to have a strong resume. Under his guidance, I was able to work on my aptitude and managed to crack my tests. He constantly helped me till the end and made me well-prepared for GDs and interviews. So I recommend you all to join the programme organised by aryan bhaiya and MAS team.",

      "Getting placed in a reputed firm like MasterCard is defintely the headstart a graduate can aspire for, but the road wasn't as easy as it seems, thanks to the pandemic and lockdown. Mentorship from seniors like Sajan bhaiya proved to be of great help. The structured roadmap, custom curated resources, effective tracking, personalized sessions and mocks not only enhanced my preparation but also bolstered my confidence. As I feel that getting the right mentorship is the key to getting sucessfully placed , I would recommend juniors preparing for Analytics and data role to get themselves enrolled in the mentorship programme offered by MySchoolAnalytics.",
